# Flask-Learning-Journal

# This is a learning journal built in part with HTML and CSS originally supplied from www.teamtreehouse.com for a Python Web Development Tech Degree Project. The HTML and CSS is to be considered built by teamtreehouse for this project(unless otherwise noted), but may be edited by me at some point.

# This is a flask based web application. The user can log in and create learning journal entries saved to a database. The user can also delete and edit any entries at will, or see the specifications about that entry.
